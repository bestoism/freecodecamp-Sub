    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 grams of spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>2-3 dried red chili peppers (or to taste)</li>
        <li>4-5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese (optional, for garnish)</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Spaghetti:</strong> Boil water in a large pot with a pinch of salt. Once boiling, add
            the spaghetti and cook until al dente, about 8-10 minutes. Drain the pasta, saving a little bit of the
            cooking water.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Aglio e Olio Oil:</strong> Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add
            the chopped garlic and dried chili peppers. Saut√© for about 1-2 minutes, until the garlic turns golden
            brown and fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine with Pasta:</strong> Add the drained spaghetti to the pan with the garlic oil. Stir
            well, adding a little bit of the reserved pasta water to make the sauce smoother and coat the pasta.</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong> Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Stir everything together until the
            pasta is well coated with the garlic oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from heat, and optionally, top with grated parmesan cheese and chopped
            parsley. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
